                Coronavirus (COVID-19) is an illness caused
                by a virus that can spread from person
                to person.
                The virus that causes COVID-19 is a new
                coronavirus that has spread throughout
                the world.
                COVID-19 symptoms can range from mild
                (or no symptoms) to severe illness. The official beginning of the virus as the world knows it
                was in December of 2019, on the 31st when the Wuhan Municipal Health Commision found a cluster of cases of pneumonia in Wuhan, Hubei
                Province in China. These people were the first official carriers of Covid-19. More and more people had the same symptoms soon, 
                and on January 13th, the first case outside of China was detected in Thailand.
                <br>
                <br>
                Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover 
                without requiring special treatment.  Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular 
                disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. 
                The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-19 virus, 
                the disease it causes and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands 
                or using an alcohol based rub frequently and not touching your face.  The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through 
                droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it’s important that you 
                also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow)

        <p id="howto">Some tips for staying healthy and avoiding catching the virus are...</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Wash your hands regularly with soap and water, or clean them with alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
            <li>Maintain at least 1 metre distance between you and people coughing or sneezing.</li>
            <li>Avoid touching your face.</li>
            <li>Cover your mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.</li>
            <li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
            <li>Refrain from smoking and other activities that weaken the lungs.</li>
            <li>Practice physical distancing by avoiding unnecessary travel and staying away from large groups of people.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Within a few weeks of the recognization of the threat, travel bans were placed in countries around the world, controlling
           the number of people who entered the country, and testing to see if they were positive. A campaign of masks was pushed around
           the world, as they disabled potential carriers from breathing/coughing on the people around them by containing their breath. 
           <br>

           If you are traveling, know this:
           Some travel activities, like the transportation you choose and where you stay, can increase your risk of getting COVID-19. 
           Your chances of exposure are higher if you come into close contact with others, especially people you don’t know, or use 
           shared public facilities (like restrooms). COVID-19 is spreading in the United States and in many international destinations.
           Visitng locations where there are fewer cases of COVID-19 may be less risky for getting COVID-19 than visiting locations where there 
           are more cases of COVID-19.
           Before you travel, learn which travel activities are lower risk to protect yourself and others. 
           Keep in mind that getting from one place to another is just one piece of the travel risk. 
           Your activities and who you interact with before, during, and after travel may increase your risk.
